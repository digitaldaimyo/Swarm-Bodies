# Progress

**Current milestone:** M1, Simulation core: complete. **Next:** M2, Bot (SPEC §15).

## M1: Simulation core: done

Scope (§15): monorepo scaffold, `sim` with Single Rock, hex grid, Grow/Reinforce/Retract, contests, connectivity, starvation, income, victory. Base values only (no strains).

- [x] pnpm workspace with `packages/sim`, `tools/balance`. TypeScript strict, ESLint (typescript-eslint strict) and Prettier.
- [x] All CLAUDE.md commands exist: `install`, `dev` (no-op until M3 adds the client), `test`, `test:e2e`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `build`, `balance`. Extra: `pnpm golden:update`.
- [x] Sim purity enforced: the sim's tsconfig has no DOM or Node types, and lint forbids `Math.random`, trig, `Date`, and `for…in`.
- [x] `createGame` for Single Rock (§4.1–4.4): rock clusters with a flood-fill region check, deposits, guaranteed home deposits, and the starting colonies.
- [x] `validateOrder` / `validateOrderSet` / `listLegalOrders` (§5.1–5.2).
- [x] `resolveTurn` phases 2–5, 8–10, 15–16 (§5.3–5.5, §3 victory).
- [x] `hashState`, `serialize`, `deserialize`, named sfc32 RNG streams (§9.2–9.3).
- [x] Acceptance: unit tests for every §5 rule (`packages/sim/test/validate.test.ts`, `resolve.test.ts`).
- [x] Acceptance: property tests (`property.test.ts`): invariants, junk-order fuzzing, determinism, key-order independence, and mirror symmetry.
- [x] Acceptance: 20 golden replays committed (`packages/sim/test/golden/replays.json`), checked in Node (Vitest) and Chromium (Playwright); WebKit runs in CI.
- [x] Acceptance: `pnpm balance -- --games N` plays random-legal games to completion without errors.
- [x] CI workflow: typecheck, lint, test, build, a balance smoke run, and Playwright.

Ambiguities resolved during M1 are in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

## Deferred to later milestones (by design)

- Phase 1 (drafts), phases 6–7 (launches, spores), 11–14 (fruiting, events, body rules, draft offers): M5/M6.
- Orbits, fixed-point trig table, `forecast()`: M5. (`isqrt` already exists.)
- Strains: M4 (Swarmer, Biofilm) and M6 (Predator, Sporer). `pnpm balance --strains` is accepted but ignored until then.
- The balance CI gate on strain win rates: M6.

## Next: M2, Bot

- Create `packages/bot` (depends on `sim` only): `chooseOrders(state, playerId, difficulty, seed)` (§13.1).
- Easy and Normal utility planners (§13.2); scenario puzzles (§13.4).
- Plug the bot into `tools/balance` as a policy (`tools/balance/src/play.ts` already takes a `Policy`).
- Acceptance: Normal beats random-legal play in ≥ 95% of 200 games; under 200 ms per turn on a Large body (with a 4× safety factor).
